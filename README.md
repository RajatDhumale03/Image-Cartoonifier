Developed an Image Cartoonifier application using OpenCV and GIMP, enabling the transformation of real-life images into cartoon-like representations. Implemented various image processing techniques, such as edge detection, color quantization, and texture
synthesis, using OpenCV to achieve the desired cartoon effect. Designed an interface for Image Cartoonifier, allowing users to upload images and view cartoonized results.
